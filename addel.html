    There’s plenty of sectors to work in; <b>be it Finance,</b> Education or Law. You choose your sector depending on your interests and <i>life goals</i>. On International Charity Day, we explore why we work in the third sector ats a nonprofit or a charity.  
    Often for those who work in the <sub>third sector</sub>, our collective goal is for social wealth and change, rather than <sup>material wealth.</sup>.Let’s delve in deeper as to why HHUGS staff chose to work in the charity sector.

    <!-- Sense of purpose  -->
    <h3> Sense of purpose</h3>
    When deciding to take on a role, it’s <strong>important your values </strong>align with the organisations, especially within the <em>charity sector</em> , as you’re working directly with people whose lives you impact. You should believe in their mission, and be passionate about the work they do.
    As Communications Executive for HHUGS, my driving force for working within the third sector is knowing that it’s my responsibility to communicate our work to others, be it to educate, inform or encourage donors.
    The Communications stream within a <u>charity showcases their work</u>, and acts as a bridge between the charity and the outside world. Whether it’s social media, a blog or an eshot, each piece of copy can be a deciding factor for someone to donate or not – ultimately changing the course of someone’s life, be it a little or large impact.
